# legally-acquired-books
The websites I downloaded this from had nowhere near enough porn ads to be considered illegal

__WARNING, THIS REPOSITORY MIGHT CONTAIN *ITALIAN*__


for a version of this that doesn't suck ass, and is actually legal, see https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books

scavanged from the following (probably) and somewhere else I probably forgot:

https://github.com

https://archive.org

https://greenteapress.com/wp/green tea press

http://www.literateprogramming.com/cweb_download.html (for the cweb manual)

https://fsf.org and https://gnu.org (mainly for emacs and elips, but there's also a smalltalk book in there)

https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/ (some chapters were too big to upload so read this one online and fuck off)

https://silo.pub/

allitebooks.whatever, it doesn't exist anymore

pdfdrive.fuckit, you know the one

the books in the repo cover the topics that are written on the fucking directories name so it's self documenting in that regard, and I'm too lazy to list them here
